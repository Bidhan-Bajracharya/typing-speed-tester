# Requirements
* Create a display box for a paragraph of text that the user will type
* Create an input box for the user to type the displayed text
* Highlight the character of the word users are currently typing (in the display box):
* GREEN - letter is correct
* RED - letter is wrong
* Create a START button for the test to begin
* Create a display box for the countdown timer
* Set a countdown time for each test
* Activate the timer when the user clicks on START
* When the timer runs out, display how many words the user typed per minute

# For an extra challenge:
* Create a drop down menu where the user can select the difficulty of the text (i.e. easy, medium, difficult). Based on the user’s selection, display the selected text.
* Calculate the accuracy (%) of the user’s inputs
* Give different words different weights: simple words like “a”, “the”, “an” etc. should weigh less than difficult words like “friendship” and “neighborhood”
* Allow users to see only one line of text, rather than the entire paragraph
* Create different types of tests for different use cases: text only, numbers only, emoji only, etc.
